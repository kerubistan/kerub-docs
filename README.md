# Kerub docs

This is an angular-based application to
 - view the wiki
 - and the test results presented as evidences
 - and therefore be more or less a documentation / reference for Kerub

It is an experiment, no one did this before.

## Test results

 - cucumber outputs in JSON format
 - JUnit reports in XML format
 - JMH reports again in JSON format

## Documentation

 Basically the GitHub MarkDown format from the Kerub wiki git.

## Who does the work in the background

 There is a Jenkins job that collects all test execution results.
